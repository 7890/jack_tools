ABOUT JACK_PLAY

jack_play is a small program to play an audio file into specified JACK
ports.  It is the reverse of Kjetil Matheussen's jack_capture program and
has been heavily based on it.


COMMON USAGE

$jack_play


ADVANCED USAGE

Usage: jack_play  [--bufsize seconds] [--channels n] [--port port] <filename>
                  [ -B seconds]       [ -c n]        [ -p port]

"Filename" has no default and must be specified.
"Channels" is by default inferred from "-p" arguments (if given) or the number
           of physical output ports available.
"Bufsize"  is by default 5 seconds.
"Port"     is by default set to all ports connected to the physical outputs.


Additional arguments:
[--playing-time s] or [-d s]     -> Playback is stopped after "s" seconds.

Examples:

To play a stereo file:
  $jack_play foobar.wav

To play a stereo file (if alsa is used):
  $jack_play --port alsa_pcm:playback_1 --port alsa_pcm:playback_2
foobar.wav

Same as above, but shorter syntax:
  $jack_play --channels 2 --port alsa_pcm:playback*

To play in to jamin:
  $jack_play --port jamin:in* sound_to_jamin.wav
